# Move Zeros To End

## Time Complexity: 
`O(N)`, where N is the length of arr. We have one loop along this array, doing operations which are all constant time. 
So it takes O(N) time.

## Space Complexity: 
`O(1)`. No additional space is used besides the pointers “read” and “write”, which in total has complexity O(1).
