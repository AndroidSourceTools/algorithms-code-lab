# Algorithms code lab

Algorithms code lab is a collection of different problems related with algorithms, data structure and other topics
related to improve software development and problem solving skills. Some topics this repository wants to cover are:
Sorting algorithms, Array manipulation, Dictionaries and Hashmaps, String manipulation, Greedy algorithms, Search
algorithms, Dynamic programming, Stack and Queues, Graphs, Trees, Linked Lists, Recursion and Backtracking.

The problems are extracted from different sources like Hackerrank, LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks,...
